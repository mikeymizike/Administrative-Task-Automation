A favored tactic for drumming up sales was to send emails with precompleted contracts to prospects for signing. This could be a tedious task involving a lot of clicking and data entry if BCCs or assigning importance/urgency in Outlook were necessary. Merge Tools makes this process slightly less onerous but it can be very brittle and you have to remember the sequence of the procedure--especially making sure to turn off send/receive in Outlook if you wanted to look over the emails before sending. Also you cannot send on behalf of another individual.

This script automates this process and creates clean emails with attachments and either saves them in the Drafts folder in Outlook for further editing or sends them directly. Easily one of the biggest time savers in the aresnal.
